# OpenAI functions

Certain OpenAI models (like gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613) have been fine-tuned to detect when a function should to be called and respond with the inputs that should be passed to the function.
In an API call, you can describe functions and have the model intelligently choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call those functions.
The goal of the OpenAI Function APIs is to more reliably return valid and useful function calls than a generic text completion or chat API.

The OpenAI Functions Agent is designed to work with these models.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/agents/openai.ts";

:::tip Compatibility
Must be used with an [OpenAI Functions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling) model.
:::

This agent also supports `StructuredTool`s with more complex input schemas.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

## Prompt customization

You can pass in a custom string to be used as the system message of the prompt as follows:

import CustomPromptExample from "@examples/agents/openai_custom_prompt.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{CustomPromptExample}</CodeBlock>
